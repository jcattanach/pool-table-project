# pool-table-project
This is my pool table project for DigitalCrafts

This is a pool table management app which will manage the pool tables in a game room. 

Here are the requested features: 

- As an admin you should be able to see all the tables (12) 

- As an admin each table in the list should show, whether the table is OCCUPIED or NOT OCCUPIED. 

- All data (start time, end time, minutes played, and cost) for each table is stored in a text file.
