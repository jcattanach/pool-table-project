# pool-table-project
This is my pool table project for DigitalCrafts

This is a pool table management app which will manage the pool tables in a game room. 

Here are the requested features: 

- As an admin you should be able to see all the tables (12) 

- As an admin each table in the list should show, whether the table is OCCUPIED or NOT OCCUPIED. 

- As an admin if the table is OCCUPIED then show the start time of the table, number of minutes played.
(Hardmode - If the minutes are > 60 then show them in terms of hours) 

- As an admin you can only give out the tables that are NOT OCCUPIED. 
This means if pool table 8 is occupied and you try to give it out then the app will print 
a message saying "Pool Table 8 is currently occupied".
